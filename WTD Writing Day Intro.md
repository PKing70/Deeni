# Write the Docs Writing Day Intro

Hello! Thank you so much for your willingness to help. Before you begin, please check out the main project [Readme](https://github.com/erin-rtfm/Deeni/blob/master/README.md), then peruse this list and choose something to work on. I've grouped needed updates into headings below to help you find the work that suits you best. Thanks again!

## Getting Started
The only thing you need to help out is a Github account! (I promise that using Github isn't hard or scary.) You can sign up for a free account at [Github.com](https://github.com/). Once you're in, you don't need any additional permission; just jump right in!

If you don't want to sign up for Github, you might be able to collaborate with someone at the table to do research for them, but you'll need to sort that out on your own.

## General Cleanup
- Proofread/copy edit topics - they all need it!
- In the [Sounds and Spelling](https://github.com/erin-rtfm/Deeni/blob/master/Cirriculum/Chapter%200:%20Introduction%20and%20Basics/Sounds%20and%20Spelling.md) topic:
  - Collect the list of consonants from the [Siletz Language website](http://www.siletzlanguage.org/additional-materials.php?category=18) and add them to the Consonants section. For now, treat any blends (e.g., "kr") as a single consonant.
  - Provide examples of Deeni consonant sounds as they are used in English, where possible.
  - Collect and link sound files for each consonant from Wikipedia.
  - Provide examples of Deeni words that begin with each consonant. (Look words up on the [Talking Dictionary](http://siletz.swarthmore.edu/).)
  - Collect and link sound files for each ejective from Wikipedia, where possible. In Deeni, ejectives are marked with an apostrophe after a consonant. (An apostrophe after a vowel is a glottal stop.)
  - Provide examples of Deeni words that include each ejective. (Look words up on the [Talking Dictionary](http://siletz.swarthmore.edu/).)

## Long-Form Writing
- In the [Sounds and Spelling](https://github.com/erin-rtfm/Deeni/blob/master/Cirriculum/Chapter%200:%20Introduction%20and%20Basics/Sounds%20and%20Spelling.md) topic:
  - Write an explanation of glottal stops. (Feel free to research on, but not copy, Wikipedia.) The existing explanations of extensions and nasalization can help you determine the right depth of detail.
  - Write an explanation of ejectives. (Feel free to research on, but not copy, Wikipedia.) The existing explanations of extensions and nasalization can help you determine the right depth of detail.
- Write practice exercises based on the content of each chapter, including some overlap content with earlier chapters. You can write practices in English only if you prefer, or include Deeni as well if you're feeling more adventurous.

## Vocabulary List Compilation
Create new vocabulary lists in the [Vocabulary](https://github.com/erin-rtfm/Deeni/tree/master/Vocabulary) directory. You can choose to just enter English terms, or you can choose to research the Deeni words. 

**For English words,** don't spend too much time thinking about what concepts might or might not exist in Deeni. Although a fascinating thought experiment, it's not terribly helpful, as tribal members have invented words to describe many new concepts (for example, cell phones!). Focus instead on the kinds of words you or another learner would find useful for each category.

**For Deeni words,** we're currently limited to what's available on the [Talking Dictionary](http://siletz.swarthmore.edu/). This isn't the only vocabulary resource available, but it is a very reliable and carefully curated one. Don't worry too much if you can't find a particular word in Deeni; keep pushing through to find what words you can. You can also choose to scrape through the resources on the [Siletz Language](http://www.siletzlanguage.org/) site.

**Additionally for Deeni words:**
- Nouns: Enter nouns alone, without a possessive prefix. For example, for the word "hand," enter _la'_ rather than _shla'_ (my hand) or _nnla'_ (your hand).
- Verbs: For the time being, I'm only interested in present progressive and simple past tenses. When adding a verb to a vocabularly list, use the "he, she, it" form. For example, if you want to add "laughing" to a list, look the word up in the dictionary and choose the entry marked _laughing, he, she, it is_. If you can't find that form, use the "I" form (e.g., _laughing, I am_) and make a note that you've done so.

Vocabulary categories:
- Family relationships
- Other personal relationships
- Names of the tribes that make up the Confederated Tribes of Siletz, Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, and the Tolowa Dee-ni' Nation. (This will definitely require some research!)
- Body parts
- Physical traits
- Personal qualities
- Emotions
- Objects one might find in a home (entryway, living room, kitchen, dining room, bedroom, bathroom, etc.)
- Objects one might find in an office, store, etc.
- Objects one might find in at school
- Colors
- Numbers, counting, and quantity
- This, that, that over there
- Question words/asking questions
- Food
- Drinks
- Weather
- Seasons
- Space/the cosmos
- Actions that typically happen during the day (e.g., waking up, brushing teeth, walking the dog, going to bed).
- Time: today, tomorrow, yesterday, etc.
- Animals
- Animal behaviors
- Other lists you think might be helpful!
