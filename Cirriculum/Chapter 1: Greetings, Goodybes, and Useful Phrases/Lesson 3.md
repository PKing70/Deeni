# Lesson 3: No

## Conversation
| | Deeni | English |
| Erin | Cheela! | Hello! |
| | Truuleene waa ‘vm-nii~-shi’? | Are you Truuleene? |
| Judy | Duu. | No. |
| | Ch’uudi waa ‘vm-nvsh-shi’. | My name is Judy. |

## Grammar Notes
In Deeni, we indicate who is doing an action by conjugating. When you conjugate a verb, you change the stem form to include new sounds. The new sounds tell you who does the action. 
Almost all Deeni verbs are split verbs. With split verbs, conjugation is done in the middle of the word. If that split is on the second syllable, it’s a 2-split verb.

- _I_ or _me_ is almost always indicated with a sh sound: _vhs_, _shi_, or _sh._
- _You_ is almost always indicated with a n sound: _i~_, _in_, or _n_.

_‘Vm-n[]-shi’_ is the stem verb meaning _called_ or _named_. To conjugate it, add the conjugation sounds between the brackets:

| Stem Verb | Conjugation Sound | Conjugated Verb | Meaning |
| ‘vm-n[]-shi’ | vsh | ‘vm-nvsh-shi’ | I am named |
| ‘vm-n[]-shi’ | ii~ | ‘vm-nii~-shi’ | You are named |

> FUN FACT: Because the person doing the action is specified in the verb, there's no need to say _I_ or _you_ separately.

Duu means no.
