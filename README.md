## Needed Updates
If you'd like to contribute, there are several options available.

### [Sounds and Spelling](https://github.com/erin-rtfm/Deeni/blob/master/Cirriculum/Chapter%200:%20Introduction%20and%20Basics/Sounds%20and%20Spelling.md) topic
* Nazalization: 
  * Write a preliminary explanation of nazalation.
  * Provide voice samples.
* Glottal stops: 
  * Write a prelimiary explanation of glottal stops.
  * Provide voice samples.
* Constants: 
  * Collect the list of consonants from the [Siletz Langauge](http://www.siletzlanguage.org/additional-materials.php?category=18) website.
  * Provide examples of the sounds as they are used in English (where possible).
  * Collect and link sound files for each consanant from Wikipedia.
  * Provide examples of Deeni words that begin with each constnant.
* Ejectives:
  * Wrote a prelimiary explanatin of ejectives.
  * Provide voice samples.
* Record and upload voice samples for all words listed in the topic.

### General Updates
* Develop practice exercies based on the content of each chapter, including some overlap content with earlier chapters.

### Big Projects I'd Like Advice On
* Develop machine learning algorithm to capture the rules of Deeni phonology. This will help us create new words that "sound right" for both concepts that have been lost as well as for concepts created after cultural genocide.

If you want to start on any of these projects, feel free to edit or create the necessary files, or [email me](mailto:thedeeniproject@gmail.com) with questions.

## Location and Format
[Add](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-new-files/) files to the Cirriculum folder. (If you prefer, you can [add files using the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line/). You can also [edit](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) files already in the folder.

Submit files in Markdown or CSV, as appropriate. To create a Markdown file, save a text file with the .md extension. Use [Git's cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to learn more about Markdown formatting. To test-drive your syntax, use the [Dillinger editor](https://dillinger.io/).

## Style Guide
In regards to English, the Deeni project uses [AP style](https://apstylebook.com/), but with the inclusion of serial commas.

For Deeni words: 
- Use hyphens only to separate suffixes and prefixes from their parent words. For example, _hii-buusri_ or _'ee-k'wee nalhda_.
- Use apostrophes to indicate glottal stops. For example, _'aame_ or _mvn'_.
- Use exclamation points to indicate ejectives. For example, _ch!eela_ or _kw!aaga_.

If you have questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding the style, contact [Erin Grace](mailto:thedeeniproject@gmail.com), the Project Maintainer.

## Commit Messages
When you [commit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#Committing-Your-Changes) changes, Git asks for a commit message. The commit message lets other conributors and Future You quickly get a sense of what changes you added to the project in that commit.

The commit message consists of a short description and a longer summary of changes. In the short description, use no more than 100 characters. In the summary, go into more detail about the changes you made. Bearing in mind that the audience is other contributors and Future You, go into as much detail as you need to make changes clear. 

You can find more commit message best practices [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

## Pull Requests
A pull request is your request for the Deeni Project to pull in your changes. You don't need permission to make a pull request. After you submit your pull request, the Project Maintainer, Erin Grace, reviews your changes. 

During a review, Erin looks at your changes and confirms they are appropriate for the project and match the commit messages you submitted. After Erin is done with their review, she can do one of four things:

1. **Accept all changes without comment.** This happens when your changes had no issues. _Your contributions will go live immediately._
2. **Accept all changes with comment.** This happens when there are small issues with your changes that don't affect their viability for the project. For example, a few minor spelling errors. You will see comments as a reply to your pull request. _Your contributions will go live immediately._
3. **Comment only.** This happens when there were some issues with your changes that need to be addressed before Erin can accept the changes. You will see the comment as a reply to your pull request. _Your changes will not go live until you make the requested changes and those additional changes are accepted._
4. **Reject all changes.** This happens when there are big issues with your changes that make them inappropriate for the project. Erin will usually leave comments detailing why your changes were rejected. _Your changes will not go live._

# Submit Issues
If you find an issue with the files that you can't or don't want to address yourself, [submit an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/). You can also submit an issue to make an enhancement request.
