# README For Write the Docs Writing Day

Hello! Thank you so much for your willingness to help. Before you begin, please check out the main project [Readme](https://github.com/erin-rtfm/Deeni/blob/master/README.md), then peruse this list and choose something to work on. I've grouped needed updates into headings below to help you find the work that suits you best. Thanks again!

## General Cleanup
- Proofread/copy edit topics - they all need it!
- In the [Sounds and Spelling](https://github.com/erin-rtfm/Deeni/blob/master/Cirriculum/Chapter%200:%20Introduction%20and%20Basics/Sounds%20and%20Spelling.md) topic:
  - Collect the list of consonants from the [Siletz Language website](http://www.siletzlanguage.org/additional-materials.php?category=18) and add them to the Consonants section. For now, treat any blends (e.g., "kr") as a single consonant.
  - Provide examples of Deeni consonant sounds as they are used in English, where possible.
  - Collect and link sound files for each consonant from Wikipedia.
  - Provide examples of Deeni words that begin with each consonant. (Look words up on the [Talking Dictionary](http://siletz.swarthmore.edu/).)
  - Collect and link sound files for each ejective from Wikipedia, where possible.

## Long-Form Writing
- In the [Sounds and Spelling](https://github.com/erin-rtfm/Deeni/blob/master/Cirriculum/Chapter%200:%20Introduction%20and%20Basics/Sounds%20and%20Spelling.md) topic:
  - Write a preliminary explanation of glottal stops. (Feel free to research on, but not copy, Wikipedia.)
  - Write a preliminary explanation of ejectives. (Feel free to research on, but not copy, Wikipedia.)
- Write practice exercises based on the content of each chapter, including some overlap content with earlier chapters.

## Vocabulary List Compilation
Create new vocabulary lists in the [Vocabulary](https://github.com/erin-rtfm/Deeni/tree/master/Vocabulary) directory. You can choose to just enter English terms, or you can choose to research the Deeni words. 

**For English words,** don't spend too much time thinking about what concepts might or might not exist in Deeni. Although a fascinating thought experiment, it's not terribly helpful, as tribal members have invented words to describe many new concepts (for example, cell phones!). Focus instead on the kinds of words you or another learner would find useful for each category.

**For Deeni words,** we're currently limited to what's available on the [Talking Dictionary](http://siletz.swarthmore.edu/). This isn't the only vocabulary resource available, but it is a very reliable and carefully curated one. Don't worry too much if you can't find a particular word in Deeni; keep pushing through to find what words you can.

**Additionally for Deeni words,** please use the base form of nouns rather than those with a possessive prefix. For example, for the word hand, add the word _la'_ rather than _shla'_ (my hand) or _nnla'_ (your hand).

Vocabulary categories:
- Family relationships
- Other personal relationships
- Names of the tribes that make up the Confederated Tribes of Siletz, Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, and the Tolowa Dee-ni' Nation. (This will definitely require some research!)
- Body parts
- Physical traits
- Personal qualities
- Emotions
- Objects one might find in a home (entryway, living room, kitchen, dining room, bedroom, bathroom, etc.)
- Objects one might find in an office, store, etc.

- Colors
- Numbers, counting, and quantity
- This, that, that over there
- Question words/asking questions
- Food

- Actions that typically happen during the day (e.g., waking up, brushing teeth, walking the dog, going to bed).
- Time: today, tomorrow, yesterday, etc.
- Animals

- Other lists you think might be helpful!
